title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

week5 ✅ Steps Completed
Connected to a SQLite database using R

Created tables and inserted sample data

Queried the database using dbGetQuery() and SQL chunks in .Rmd

Used sqldf() to run SQL queries directly on R data frames

Exported query results to CSV

Wrote entire data frames into the SQLite database with dbWriteTable()

Used prepared statements and explained bound parameters

Handled and avoided warnings (like open result sets) with proper cleanup

Managed, searched, and deleted .sqlite/.db files from your system

Verified data, printed outputs, and wrapped up neatly!


Avoid Warnings: Always Clear Results
Always run dbClearResult() after dbSendQuery() or dbSendStatement() or you’ll get:

“Warning: Closing open result set, pending rows”

Use dbExecute() when you don't need to fetch or bind.
